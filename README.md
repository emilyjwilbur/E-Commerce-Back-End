# E-Commerce-Back-End


## User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Description:

This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.




## Installation:
Run the following commands;
run```npm install mysql2```,
run```npm install sequelize```,
run```npm install dotenv```

## Usage:
To connect to the database run ```mysql -u root -p``` and enter password from .env file. Then source the schema.sql. To seed the file run ```npm run seed```. Finally to connect to the server ```run npm start```.
